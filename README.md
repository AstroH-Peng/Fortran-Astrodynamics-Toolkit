A modern Fortran library for astrodynamics.

Overview
---------------

The goal is to produce a comprehensive library, written in modern Fortran (Fortran 2003/2008), of all the standard orbital mechanics algorithms such as:

 * Lambert solvers
 * Kepler propagators
 * ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta, Nystrom, Adams)
 * Orbital element conversions
 * Force models (point mass gravity, geopotential, solar radiation pressure, drag)
 * Reference frames
 * Targeting and optimization
 * Engine models

This is a work in progress, and is currently in a very preliminary state.
