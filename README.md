Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit
=============================

A modern Fortran library for astrodynamics.

This is a work in progress. The goal is to include modern Fortran implementations of all the standard orbital mechanics algorithms such as:

 * Lambert solvers
 * Kepler propagators
 * ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta, Nystrom, Adams)
 * Orbital element conversions
